# Caldrun Jumper 2

This game is based on my InnoGames Game Jam #9 game, which you can find at its [GitHub repo](https://github.com/progsource/caldrun-jumper).

But this time without a possibility to enter your name for a highscore (yet).

## tech

It uses Cocos2dx instad of Phaser this time. So everything is now about C++.

## controls

Like the original game the controls are:

* Left: A / Left cursor
* Right: D / Right cursor
* Stop: S / Down cursor
* Jump: W / Up cursor / space

So at the moment without the Numpad keys.

## How to run

This depends on your system. Read how to do it in the [cocos2dx docs](http://www.cocos2d-x.org/learn).
Or look into the related [README](cocos2d/README.md) file.
There is nothing system related in this game except that it needs a keyboard to be playable.
